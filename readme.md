## How to set up our Project:

- Clone repo
- run `npm i` to install node modules and dependencies
- `nodemon ./src/server.js` to run project from root folder
- `tape ./tests/test.js` to run tests from root folder

## Our Process:

- Look for awesome gifs
- Scaffold our project as a 4:
  - Add tape, tap-spec, supertest, and es-lint dev dependencies
  - Create empty files and folders in the terminal (to serve front end assets via node)
  - Whiteboard what the mentors _may_ tell us to do on Thursday. Well, actually sketch it out on some lined paper
  - Look at the `require` node module, think of how it may work to make requests on the back end.

## We did a little bit of espionage on Wednesday afternoon:
